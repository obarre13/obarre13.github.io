<p>About Me</p>
 <p> Hi my name is Osman Barre and I am 22 years of age. I was born in Toronto and moved to the United States to do my High School Studies, and came back when I graduated.
 I am the middle child of 5, so I have a good sense of leadership and social skills from growing up with a big family.
 My parents always taught me that whatever you do in life always put your all into it, regardless of the situation.
 That  advice has always helped me out through the years.
 Growing up technology has always played a big part in my life, in this day in time everything we use runs off technology, so i thought to myself this industry would be suit me.
 Getting accepted into the Npower Canada Program made a huge impact in my life, itâ€™s an amazing opportunity to help gain more of understanding of the technical information i need to grow in this field, but also help me develop the right characteristics to make succeed in life in general.
 After finishing this program I hope to launch my career as a Software Developer in either the Financial or Entertainment industry.
  I genuinely look forward to seeing everyone succeed, so if you would like to connect whether it is to talk about ideas, or ask questions and find out more, feel free to reach out to me! </p>
